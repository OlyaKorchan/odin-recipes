    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix peanut butter, white sugar, and egg in a medium bowl until smooth.
        Roll mixture into 1-inch balls and place 1 inch apart on an ungreased
        baking sheet; flatten each with a fork, making a criss-cross pattern.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are just barely brown on the
        bottoms, about 6 to 8 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets briefly before
        removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
